    "Other improvements could be made on the pKa for the molecules. Not all molecules have a pKa from PubChem, and thus a pKa estimation could be used. Additionally, some molecules such as the sodium *tert*-butoxide do not have a pKa listed, but have a parent compound listed that has a pKa listed (in this case, *tert*-butanol).\n",

    "Furthermore, as mentioned before, the estimations for chromatography rely heavily on approximations and do not take into account many factors. To improve our chromatography tools, those factors such as dipole moment and hydrogen bonds can be taken into account and factored in the calculation."
